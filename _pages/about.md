I'm a neuroscientist and computational biologist, with a deep love of old papers and new tools. 

I work across a wide variety of fields:  
- strategic decision-making for business and technical roadmaps in both tech and biotech
- ML and deep learning for bioinformatics in microscopy, molecular biology, and neuroscience
- breaking new ground in ethical and explainable AI.
